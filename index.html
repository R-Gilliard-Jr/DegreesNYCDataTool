                <h3><strong>Introduction and Instructions</strong></h3>
                <p class="basic_para"> 
                    The graphs throughout this application are intended to display the paths students take
                    to and through college, beginning in their freshman year of high school. Each of the tabs
                    contains a bar graph which can be be updated to show students in different 9th grade cohorts,
                    of different race/ethnicity, gender, from different Boroughs, and with different education
                    statuses, among other characteristics. The following dropdown menus and sliders appear on one or more
                    of the tabs:
                    <ul class="basic_list">
                        <li>
                            Primary Characteristic: Users can select a primary characteristic, 
                            which will change the rows that appear on the graph.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Secondary Characteristic: Users can select a secondary characteristic.
                            Change the options available in the subgroup dropdown menu (discussed below)
                            and will update the graph to contain only data for the default subgroup.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Subgroup: Users can select a subset of the secondary characteristic.
                            For example, if the secondary characteristic is "Gender", users can
                            select either "Male" or "Female".
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            High School Graduation: Users can select the timing of high school graduation:
                            ever, on-time, or late.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            College Enrollment Level: Users can select the college enrollment level of interest:
                            any, two year, or four year college.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Years Persisted: Users can select the number of years of persistence of interest:
                            two or three.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cohort: Users can adjust the cohort of interest. The years represent
                            the year that students in the cohort started ninth grade.
                        </li>

                <h3><strong>Dos and Don'ts with the Data</strong></h3>
                <div class="basic_para">
                    The chart(s) throughout this application present aggregated high school data for students who attended school
                    in the NYCDOE. The data can be broken up along many different dimensions: race/ethnicity, gender,
                    English language learners, individualized education program status, and free/reduced price lunch eligibility. The best
                    data is not without bias, and further bias is added as data is interpreted. Here are some dos and 
                    dont's to consider as you explore the chart(s) on this page.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Do:</strong> Remember that, though these groups are presented separately here, they are not independent phenomena in reality. 
                            Students can have more than one of these identities and the consequences of discrimination mean that students experiencing one 
                            form of marginalization are likely to experience others.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Don't:</strong> Neglect the the impact of discrimination on student outcomes. As differences emerge 
                            in these charts, consider what barriers students in different groups are exposed to that prevent them 
                            from reaching their full potential. Avoid overly simplistic conclusions about student ability.
                        </li>
