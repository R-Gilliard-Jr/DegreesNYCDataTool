                    <p class="d-block w-100"> 
                        The graphs throughout this application are intended to display the paths students take
                        to and through college, beginning in their freshman year of high school. A series of bar graphs is presented, that
                         can be be updated to show students in different 9th grade cohorts,
                        of different race/ethnicity, gender, from different Boroughs, and with different education
                        statuses, among other characteristics. The following dropdown menus and sliders appear on one or more
                        of the charts:
                        <ul class="basic_list">
                            <li>
                                Student Characteristic: Charts can be explored within student characteristics. 
                                Changing the value in this dropdown will change the rows that appear on the graph as well as 
                                the selectable additional characteristics.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Additional Characteristic: Where appropriate, users can drilldown by an additional characteristic.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                College Level: On the charts depicting college-level outcomes, users can select whether to
                                examine outcomes for students who attended a four year or two year college, two year only, or four year only.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Years Persisted: The persistence chart can be examined by number of years persisted: two or three.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                9th Grade Cohort: The data is examined within 9th grade cohorts. Years represent
                                the year that students in that cohort began 9th grade.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3><strong>Examining a Cohort</strong></h3>
                    <p class="basic_para">
                        We mention it elsewhere, but it is important to keep in mind that all figures in the dashboard are within a 9th Grade Cohort.
                        To take an example, consider the 2009 cohort. On the specialized high school chart, the cohort year and the outcome year align:
                        enrollment in a specialized high school would have had to occur in 2009 for a student to be in the 2009 9th grade cohort. As we progress
                        through the charts, however, the cohort year and the outcome year diverge. A student in the 2009 cohort would have been on-track in 9th
                        grade in 2010, an on-time high school graduate in 2013, and an on-time college enrolle in 2013 as well. Nevertheless, the 9th Grade Cohort 
                        slider will always show 2009. As a result, data for a cohort may not be available for all outcomes because the cohort itself may not have
                        had time to reach that point in the high-school through college trajectory.

                    <h3><strong>Dos and Don'ts with the Data</strong></h3>
                    <div class="basic_para">
                        The chart(s) throughout this application present aggregated high school data for students who attended school
                        in the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE). The data can be broken up along many different dimensions: race/ethnicity, gender,
                        English language learners, individualized education program status, and free/reduced price lunch eligibility. The best
                        data is not without bias, and further bias is added as data is interpreted. Here are some dos and 
                        dont's to consider as you explore the chart(s) on this page.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Do:</strong> Remember that, though these groups are presented separately here, they are not independent in reality. 
                                Students can have more than one of identity and the consequences of discrimination mean that students experiencing one 
                                form of marginalization are likely to experience others.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Don't:</strong> Neglect the the impact of discrimination on student outcomes. As differences emerge 
                                in these charts, consider what barriers students in different groups are exposed to that prevent them 
                                from reaching their full potential. Avoid overly simplistic conclusions about student ability.
                            </li>
